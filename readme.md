# E-Commerce Web App Test Automation â€“ Presta Shop

#### This project contains a suite of automated end-to-end tests for a sample e-commerce web application using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) and [Python](https://www.python.org/).

The goal of this project is to implement a maintainable, scalable, and professional-grade test automation framework.

## Features

- Built with **pytest** for clean and readable test syntax
- Implements the **Page Object Model (POM)** design pattern for better modularity and reusability
- Includes a shared **BasePage** class to reduce code duplication and centralize common actions
- Designed to be easily extendable for future test cases and pages
